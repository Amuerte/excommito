# Ex commito

Theme is based on Hydejack (v5), the pretentious two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme derived from [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com).

**[Click here for demo](http://kray.me)**

## Why The Fork?

With *Ex commito* my intention is to improve the UX of original Hydejack theme by adding nerd features on top of it.  

By some aspects, *Ex commito* can be perceived like a polished front store to your blog repository. It brings some dynamic information (comments, post edits history) to the static nature of the site by leveraging (diverting?) some Github features.

Theme is shipped with, in no particular order:

- an *article* layout with dropcaps. Code taken from [libretto](https://github.com/ferrolho/jekyll-theme-libretto)
- *link* metadata attribute to attach link to a post title. Github logo is appended to article title when the link points to a github project
- most recent post is featured on homepage
- unobtrusive social sharing text links in post header
  - *Drafts* link in side bar, points to issues (early drafts) or PR (drafts) of future posts
  - *Fingerprint* link in side bar, points to last commit diff
  - *History* link in post header, points to current post history
  - *Comment* link in post header, point to current post issue thread
