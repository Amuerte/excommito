# Ex commito

Theme is based on Hydejack, the pretentious two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme derived from [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com).

## Why the fork

- [x] dropcaps for article layout. Code taken from [libretto](https://github.com/ferrolho/jekyll-theme-libretto)
- [x] *link* metadata attribute to attach link to article. Github logo is appended to article title when linking to a github
  project.
