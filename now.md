My time is split between Paris and Bordeaux.
Moving the family to Bordeaux is planned for first of July.

Home in Bordeaux is a 6 minutes bike ride from work, has a vegetable garden in a quiet
neighborhood.
Got my first car at 35 y o ! Glad that it's dealt and that we'll be able to move for the
summer week ends to come.
Always thought my first car would be an hybrid, didn't happen.

Have been quite prolific on github these last months, small projects that I use daily, and this
blog redesign.
Should spend less brain time on coding and more on languages, like practicing spanish I hardly
learnt on Duolinguo 2 years ago.

I'll spent the next 3 weeks alone in Bordeaux and the goal will be to make daily sports activity.
