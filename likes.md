Technostalgic, I miss the web of the 2000' ruled by mail and RSS.  
I used facebook at its beginning, but dropped it years ago when issues with 
privacy and sponsored content became obvious.

Nowadays, I send mails to my relatives when I want to share an interesting 
page, but I'd like to take the habit to save all my liked urls to my 
[blurblog](kraymer.newsblur.com).  
The RSS feed is at [http://www.newsblur.com/social/rss/39542/kraymer](http://www.newsblur.com/social/rss/39542/kraymer).
