This post you are currently reading is a draft, a *half-baked/non-polished* blog post.  
Blogging is hard. Original ideas are there, some thoughts I have or work I've done, that could be 
of some interest for the community.  
Yet, going from a one sentence idea to a full blog post takes time and brain sweat. So more often than 
not, these ideas stayed in my blog repository labelled as `draft`, meaning they never get the 
chance to experience the *www*.  
Well ... until now.  

Embracing the [*ship early, ship often*](https://blog.ycombinator.com/tips-ship-early-and-often/) 
adage, Ex commito theme treats your drafts differently than others, considering them *almost* 
as first-class citizen.  
As such, drafts share following properties :
- same permalink structure than posts (so external links don't get broken when status 
change from draft to post) 
- searchable on google
- they are proposed in *Related posts* sections

*Draft appearing in related posts section*

- but are not mixed with posts in your articles navigation (previous/next links)
- custom layout with prominent note warning of the draft status

Last but not least, the draft layout footer links to a github page where your readers can vote for 
which draft they are the more interested in to see finished. Because publishing draft is not an end
 in itself, but a way to gather from your audience the incentive to get your blogging job done.
