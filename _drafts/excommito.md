*Ex commito* theme is my latest attempt for a minimal theme to empower my blog.

It is based on Hydejack (v5), the pretentious two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme derived from [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com).


## Minimal and bold

## Crowdsource the editing process

When you have an ounce of idea that could give a post, enter it in the issue tracked labelled with the Drafts tag.
It's shipping reduced to its simple expression.
Website readers have access to these Drafts via the link in the sidebar, and will hopefully share reactions about which ones of these ideas they are interested in seeing developed on the blog.


I tag all *Ex commito* use `Draft` issue labels to
The hardest thing in blogging is *blogging*. Producing content.
The lack of incentive to write can be a killer. How many drafts left unfinished for a published post ?




How many ideas of subjects I want to talk, pass the draft stage to be published on the site ? Victims of my lost of interest

Although visually, Ex commito and Hydejack look like two peas in a pod,
Hydejack theme is a great theme to start pimping : clean and minimal.

The changes I inflict to the theme are not esthetical ones, I edit css code only when strictly necessary.


With *Ex commito* my intention is keep the clean and minimal Hydejack look
to improve the UX of original Hydejack theme by adding nerd features on top of it.

By some aspects, *Ex commito* can be perceived like a polished front store to your blog repository. It brings some dynamic information (comments, post edits history) to the static nature of the site by leveraging (diverting?) some Github features.

Theme is shipped with, in no particular order:

- an *article* layout with dropcaps. Code taken from [libretto](https://github.com/ferrolho/jekyll-theme-libretto)
- *link* metadata attribute to attach link to a post title. Github logo is appended to article title when the link points to a github project
- most recent post is featured on homepage
- unobtrusive social sharing text links in post header
- a *now page*
- easter egg: navigation through posts *à la Google* by clicking the "o" of the site title
- links to Github pages :
  - *Drafts* link in side bar, points to issues (early drafts) or PR (drafts) of future posts
  - *Fingerprint* link in side bar, points to last commit diff
  - *History* link in post header, points to current post history
  - *Comment* link in post header, point to current post issue thread





## UI




is an attempt to divert some Github ui features for your blog profit :
- store post comments in issue threads
-
- post comments can be toogled on by adding an `issue` to post metadata

Github is a platform that hosts open source projects.
It helps users to interact with their beloved projects :
- vote for feature requests on the issue
- comment on code in PR reviews
- browse edits applied to a file in its lifetime

Jekyll is a blog engine that delivers static websites.
It gives you text for you to read.

One common setup aka Github Pages consist to host your Jekyll blog on Github.
Why not bring Github community features to the blogging world ?

With *Ex commito* I take the opposite approach and bring some features of the back shop into the
light.
Want to comment on a post ? Leave a comment on the post associated issue thread.
If edit a post already published, should I add an 'Edit <date>' section ? Nah, people can just check the post history.
Wondering what next posts are in the queue ? Go see drafts on issue tracker.


It takes text files from the back shop (github repository) and put them in the storefront (your
website) for you to read.

The fact that the blog files are hosted on github is not always mentioned, a detail of
implementation.
## Why The Fork?

Hydejack was just the perfect basic theme for me to start as it matches my minimalist expectation
with a clean codebase.
As a general guideline I tend to limit the number of tools I use and dependencies, and I treated
blogging the same way.

You code locally, commit, iterate, and when you're done you pu(bli)sh.
Why blogging is not more like that ?
I want Ex commito to be the place when I can share my ideas, yet blog posts are the good format
