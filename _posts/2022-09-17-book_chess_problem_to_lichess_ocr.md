A common advice when reading a chess book is to reproduce the exercices OTB.  
Yet, for casual players that play exclusively online, setting up a chessboard can be a burden. Without it, visualizing the exercice becomes a tedious task, and make the overall experience less enjoyable.

Here is how I proceed to practise book exercises using Lichess etudes :  

1- create a study on Lichess named after the book  
2- open [Chessvision.ai](https://chessvision.ai/) application on your smartphone and take a picture of the checkboard  
3- click the ☰ button and press _Study_, select the aforementioned study  
4- scroll down and click ⚙ to edit the name of the created chapter
