Six months ago, I forked a 10 years old [plugin](https://github.com/jasonmyers/PythonAutoImport) that do auto-imports and contributed [a fix](https://github.com/jasonmyers/PythonAutoImport/commit/fc7c7551a20a717576b85b54e12ff8683d140e45) so it works gracefully now with multi-lines import.

After months using it I can safely says it improved my use of ST3 and so share it here for those that spend a hell lot of time in ST3 to write import statements.
