<p>This post is about <strong>Rule-based music library management</strong>, term coined by Dan Gravell,  who&rsquo;ve put it at the heart of his automatic tagging software <em><a href="http://www.blisshq.com/">bliss</a></em>. I&rsquo;ll adress the topic of bliss features in a later post, to focus today on the concept of rules and how I use them in my tagging routine.</p>

<h3>Rules really tie your library together</h3>

<p>Digital music is like plasticine : bulk raw data crying out for <strong>structure</strong>. <br />
Just stacking it up before playing with it will invariably result in an undescriptable mess with no hope to find your way through.</p>

<p>Stand back, have a <strong>global view</strong> of the collection you&rsquo;re building. Is it tuneful or conflicted ?</p>

<p>Bring harmony to your library : avoid genres fragmentation, names mispelling, get rid of inconsistencies (<em>&lsquo;feat&rsquo;</em> vs <em>&lsquo;ft&rsquo;</em> anyone?)&hellip; <strong>Shape it</strong>.<br />
Entering well-thought metadata information contributes heavily to this shaping as it enables efficient browsing based on tracks descriptive attributes (genre, release year, <em>etc</em>). File-naming conventions and storage of albums related files (as opposed to embedded album metadata) are other aspects to consider when sculpting your library.</p>

<p>In a rule-oriented library management system, you strive for <strong>musical data consistency</strong>, by applying the same set of rules to all the elements that compose your library.</p>

<h3>Those are my f*cking rules !</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Must-have tags</strong><br />
Following tags cannot be left blank : <em>Artist</em>, <em>Album Artist</em>,<em>Title</em>, <em>Album</em>, <em>Genre</em>, <em>Year</em>, <em>Replaygain</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Various artists corner case #1</strong><br />
<em>Album Artist</em> is set to <em>&lsquo;Various Artists&rsquo;</em> for compilations, unless something else makes sense (eg DJ or producer name).</li>
<li><strong>No genres galore</strong><br />
Minimum number of tracks required for creating a new  <em>Genre</em> category is 50.</li>
<li><strong>Cover art for desktop</strong> <br />
A high resolution of front album cover is saved in album folder under the name <em>cover_hd.jpg</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Cover art for mobile</strong>  <br />
A lower resolution (~400x400, ~40kb) of <em>cover_hd.jpg</em> is embedded into tags.</li>
<li><strong>File-naming pattern</strong><br />
Default naming pattern is <em>Artist-Album-Year/track_number-title.mp3</em></li>
<li><strong>Various artists corner case #2</strong><br />
Artists names must figure in tracks paths for compilations : <em>VA-Album-Year/track_number-artist-title.mp3</em></li>
<li><strong>Ratings</strong> <br />
Ratings are stored in <em>Grouping</em> tag using a 5 star scale (see <a href="/blog/resilient-id3-embedded-ratings">Resilient ID3 embedded ratings</a>).</li>
</ol>


<p>I didn&rsquo;t come up straight off with that list , as it&rsquo;s rather the result of an incremental process spanning over years.  <br />
Some rules arised belatedly and I&rsquo;m still sweating today to make my oldest tracks abide by them (blasted <em>#8</em> and its stupid stars! I knew I should have gone with the <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/quotes?qt=qt0464765">&lsquo;Mark it zero!&rsquo;</a></em> approach ;).<br />
Yet, most of my rules can be applied somewhat automatically by software means&hellip;</p>

<p>So stay tuned to learn what tools I use to ease the process!</p>
