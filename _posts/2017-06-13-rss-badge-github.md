One not-so-known feature of github is its atom feeds to track projects releases deliveries.<br>
You can subscribe to it at :

`https://github.com/<user>/<project>/releases.atom`

I like that so much that I now add a ![releases badge](/public/img/posts/rss-badge.svg)
badge to all my projects to make that more visible.
