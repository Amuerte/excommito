<p>iTunes DJ is like my personal radio. I use a unique smart playlist as source, delivering a first-class digest of my library.
This way I can achieve a selection of <strong>homogeneous quality</strong> that spans a <strong>wide spectrum of genres</strong>.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested to build your own <em>Grand Mix</em> playlist, consider to combine the following filterings to refine your library content :</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Focus on the tunes that you like</strong><br />
It&rsquo;s hard to conceive a routine-playlist that doesn&rsquo;t filter ratings in some way. Be strict but not too much, or the resulting pool of songs will be too restricted.<br />
Having a ratings metric defined, this step is a no-brainer : <a href="/blog/howto-define-ratings-system">on my scale</a> it sets the bar at <em>3★</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bias to play the best songs</strong><br />
Some players offer to boost occurrences of highly rated tunes. It&rsquo;s a nice way to rise the quality while keeping a large pool of songs to dip into.<br />
Have you ever wondered what does result from activating the <em>Play higher rated songs more often</em> iTunes DJ setting? I did the test (see graph below).<br />
I like how not only <em>5★</em> but <em>4★</em> songs distribution too are positively affected by this setting.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Low bitrate ditching</strong><br />
Do you play music through good hi-fi speakers? Then, it may help to ignore files not satisfying a minimum quality standard by keeping only those whose <em>Bit Rate</em> is greater than a given threshold.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Genre rebalancing</strong><br />
I used to be a reggae monomaniac during my boyhood, my tastes have considerably spread since but I have accumulated a large number of reggae releases from these years, making this genre over-represented in my library.<br />
The solution to deal with an unbalanced library, dominated by few genres when you strive for diversity, consists to apply <strong>ratings filterings by genre</strong>.<br />
In my case, ratings threshold for reggae songs is <em>4★</em> whereas songs rated as low as <em>3★</em> are accepted for others genres.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Genre exclusion</strong>  <br />
Sometimes the perceived quality depend highly on the listening context: classic example is <em>Christmas songs</em>, always welcomed for snowy days, not that much the rest of the year. In the same vein, I would play clubbing tunes during a party but otherwise this genre tends to quickly bore me. <br />
These context-specific songs are outside of the scope of a daily routine playlist, so I prefer to simply filter out their corresponding genres.</p></li>
</ul>
